Git ignore is built from [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore) so it's reproducible. We use the `Python` and `macOS` recipes at least.

Should there be additional changes, those are included at the beginning of the file, before the gitignore.io comment. A comment explains the purpose of the change.

Should a change be necessary at the bottom of the file, it is mentioned at the beginning of the file.
